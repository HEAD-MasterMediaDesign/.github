# Master Media Design

### Interaction design in the age of AI and the ecological transition

The MA in Media Design is for students who want to specialize in interaction design and explore its potential. Over two years, you will create digital narratives, interfaces, games, immersive experiences, and interactive installations. You will engage with creative coding and tools such as AI, VR, AR, and game engines. Beyond purely technical training, you will conduct field research in order to create scenarios, understand user needs and design concepts that balance innovation with a human-centered, social, and environmentally responsible approach.

The program revolves around three main topics. The first you will investigate the evolving landscape of human-machine interactions, using machine learning processes as you learn to “talk to robots”. The second, “interaction design with limited resources”, focuses on prototyping experiences that minimize the environmental footprint. Third, “games and narratives”, will teach you how to craft new storytelling and interactive experiences.

The first year includes practical and theoretical classes taught by professors and international guest lecturers. You will have opportunities to collaborate with brands and public institutions, gain professional experience, and showcase your work at festivals. The second year is dedicated to your personal diploma project. Supported by a tutor, you will develop your project from its exploratory to its production phase, while reflecting on its related exposure and communication.

By the end of the course, you will be prepared for careers in creative industries, entrepreneurship, or research as an interaction designer, game designer, creative technologist, digital media producer, entrepreneur, VR artist, or user experience researcher.
